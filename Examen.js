//Given an input string, reverse the string word by word. For example:
//given s = "the sky is blue", return "blue is sky the".

Let estring = "";
for (let i = 0; i < estring.length; i++) {
    console.log 
    
}

//Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. 
//For example, the longest substring without repeating letters for "abcabcbb" is"abc",
//which the length is 3. For "bbbbb" the longest substring is "b", with the length of 1.



//Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a wordList of approved words, find the length of the shortest
//transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord such that:
//Only one letter can be changed at a time
//Each transformed word must exist in the wordList.
//Return the length of the shortest transformation sequence, or 0 if no such transformation sequence exists.
//Note: beginWord does not count as a transformed word. You can assume that beginWord and endWord are not
//empty and are not the same.
//Example:  For beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", and wordList = ["hot", "dot", "lot", "log", "cog"],
//the output should be wordLadder(beginWord, endWord, wordList) = 5.
//The shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog" with a length of 5
